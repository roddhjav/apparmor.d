**Full set of AppArmor profiles**

## Description 

**AppArmor.d** is a set of over 1400 AppArmor profiles whose aim is to confine
most Linux based applications and processes.

**Purpose**

- Confine all root processes such as all `systemd` tools, `bluetooth`, `dbus`,
  `polkit`, `NetworkManager`, `OpenVPN`, `GDM`, `rtkit`, `colord`
- Confine all Desktop environments
- Confine all user services such as `Pipewire`, `Gvfsd`, `dbus`, `xdg`, `xwayland`
- Confine some *"special"* user applications: web browser, file browser...
- Should not break a normal usage of the confined software

**Goals**

- Target both desktops and servers
- Support all distributions that support AppArmor:
    * Archlinux
    * Ubuntu 22.04
    * Debian 11
    * OpenSUSE Tumbleweed
- Support all major desktop environments:
    * Currently only Gnome
- Fully tested (Work in progress)


> This project is originaly based on the work from [Morfikov][upstream] and aims
> to extend it to more Linux distributions and desktop environements.

## Concepts

*One profile a day keeps the hacker away*

There are over 50000 Linux packages and even more applications. It is simply not
possible to write an AppArmor profile for all of them. Therefore, a question arises:

**What to confine and why?**

We take inspiration from the [Android/ChromeOS Security Model][android_model] and
we apply it to the Linux world. Modern [Linux security distributions][clipos] usually
consider an immutable core base image with a carefully selected set of applications.
Everything else should be sandboxed. Therefore, this project tries to confine all
the *core* applications you will usually find in a Linux system: all systemd services,
xwayland, network, bluetooth, your desktop environment... Non-core user applications
are out of scope as they should be sandboxed using a dedicated tool (minijail,
bubblewrap, toolbox...).

This is fundamentally different from how AppArmor is usually used on Linux servers
as it is common to only confine the applications that face the internet and/or the users.
