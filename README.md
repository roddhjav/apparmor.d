[![][workflow]][action] [![][build]][project]  [![][quality]][goreportcard]

**Full set of AppArmor profiles**

> **Warning**: This project is still in early development. Help is very welcome
> see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) 

## Description 

A set of over 1200 AppArmor profiles which aims is to confine most of Linux base
applications and processes.

**Goals & Purpose**
- Support all distributions that support AppArmor:
  * *Currenlty*: Archlinux, Debian 11 and the last Ubuntu LTS.
  * Not (yet) tested on openSUSE
- Target both desktop and server,
- Confine all root processes. Eg: all systemd tools, bluetooth, dbus, polkit,
  NetworkManager, OpenVPN, GDM, rtkit, colord...
- Confine all Desktop environments:
  * *Currently only Gnome*, see `apparmor.d/groups/gnome`
- Confine all user services: Eg: Pipewire, Gvfsd, dbus, xdg, xwayland...
- Confine some "special" user applications: web browser, file browser...
- Should not break a normal usage of the confined software.
- Fully tested (Work in progress),

> This project is based on the excellent work from [Morfikov][upstream] and aims
to extend it to more Linux distributions and desktop environements.


## Concepts

There are over 50000 Linux packages and even more applications. It is simply not possible to write an AppArmor profile for all of them. Therefore a question arises: *What to confine and why?*

We take inspiration from the [Android/ChromeOS Security Model][android_model] and we apply it to the Linux world. Modern [linux security implementation][clipos] usually consider a core base image with a carefully set of selected applications. Everything else should be sandboxed. Therefore, this project tries to confine all the *core* applications you will usually find in a Linux system: all systemd services, xwayland, network, bluetooth, your desktop environment... Non-core user applications are out of scope as they should be sandboxed using a dedicated tool (minijail, bubblewrap...).

This is fundamentally different from how AppArmor is used on Linux server as it is common to only confine the applications that face the internet and/or the users.



## Installation

**Requirements**
* An `apparmor` based linux distribution.
* Base profiles and abstractions shipped with AppArmor are supposed to be
  installed.
* Go (build dependency only)
* rsync (build dependency only)

**Archlinux**

Build and install the package with:
```sh
makepkg -s
sudo pacman -U apparmor.d-*.pkg.tar.zst \
  --overwrite etc/apparmor.d/tunables/global \
  --overwrite etc/apparmor.d/tunables/xdg-user-dirs
```

> **Warning**: for a first install, it is recommanded to install all profiles in complain mode. See [Complain mode](#troubleshooting)

**Debian / Ubuntu**

Build using standard Debian package build tools:
```sh
sudo apt install apparmor-profiles build-essential config-package-dev debhelper golang-go rsync git
git clone https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d.git && cd apparmor.d
dpkg-buildpackage -b -d --no-sign
sudo dpkg --force overwrite -i ../apparmor.d_*_all.deb
```

> **Warning**: for a first install, it is recommanded to install all profiles in complain mode. See [Complain mode](#troubleshooting)

**Partial install**

For test purpose, you can install a specific profile with the following commands. The tool will also install required abstractions and tunables:
```
sudo ./pick <profiles-name>
```


## Usage

**Enabled profiles**

Once installed and with the rules enabled, you can ensure the rules are loaded
with `sudo aa-satus`, it should give something like:
```
apparmor module is loaded.
1137 profiles are loaded.
794 profiles are in enforce mode.
   ...
343 profiles are in complain mode.
   ...
0 profiles are in kill mode.
0 profiles are in unconfined mode.
130 processes have profiles defined.
108 processes are in enforce mode.
   ...
22 processes are in complain mode.
   ...
0 processes are unconfined but have a profile defined.
0 processes are in mixed mode.
0 processes are in kill mode.
```

You can also list the current processes alongside with their security profile with
`ps auxZ`. Most of the process should then be confined.

**AppArmor Log**

The provided command `aa-log` allow you review AppArmor generated messages in a
colorful way:

```
$ aa-log
   ...
```

`aa-log` can optionally be given a profile name as argument to
only show the log for a given profile:
```
$ aa-log dnsmasq
DENIED  dnsmasq open /proc/sys/kernel/osrelease comm=dnsmasq requested_mask=r denied_mask=r
DENIED  dnsmasq open /proc/1/environ comm=dnsmasq requested_mask=r denied_mask=r
DENIED  dnsmasq open /proc/cmdline comm=dnsmasq requested_mask=r denied_mask=r
```


## Personalisation

**AppArmor configuration**

As they are a lot of rules, it is recommended to enable caching AppArmor profiles.
In `/etc/apparmor/parser.conf`, uncomment `write-cache` and `Optimize=compress-fast`.
See [Speed up AppArmor Start] on the Arch Wiki for more information.


**Personal directories**

The profiles heavily use the XDG directory variables defined in `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/xdg-user-dirs`. You can personalise these values with by creating a
file such as `/etc/apparmor.d/tunables/xdg-user-dirs.d/perso` with (for example)
the following content:
```sh
@{XDG_VIDEOS_DIR}+="Films"
@{XDG_MUSIC_DIR}+="Musique"
@{XDG_PICTURES_DIR}+="Images"
@{XDG_BOOKS_DIR}+="BD" "Comics"
@{XDG_PROJECTS_DIR}+="Git" "Papers"
```

**Local profiles**

You can extend a profile with your own rules by creating a file in the 
`/etc/apparmor.d/local/` directory. For example, to extend the `gnome-shell`
profile, create a file `/etc/apparmor.d/local/gnome-shell` and add your rules.
Then, reload the apparmor rules with `sudo systemctl restart apparmor`.


## Troubleshooting

**Complain mode**

On first install and for test purposes, it is recommended to pass all profiles
in *complain* mode. To do this, edit `PKGBUILD` on Archlinux or `debian/rules`
on Debian and add the `--complain` option to the configure script. Then build
the package as usual:
```sh
./configure --complain 
```

**AppArmor messages**

Ensure that `auditd` is installed and running on your system in order to read
AppArmor log from `/var/log/audit/audit.log`. Then you can see the log with `aa-log`


**System Recovery**

Issue in some core profiles like the systemd suite, or the desktop environment
can fully break your system. This should not happen a lot, but if it does here
is the process to recover your system on Archlinux:
1. Boot from a Archlinux live USB
1. If you root partition is encryped, decrypt it: `cryptsetup open /dev/<your-disk-id> vg0`
1. Mount your root partition: `mount /dev/<your-plain-disk-id> /mnt`
1. Chroot into your system: `arch-chroot /mnt`
1. Check the AppArmor messages to see what profile is faulty: `aa-log`
1. Temporarily fix the issue with either:
   - When only one profile is faultly, remove it: `rm /etc/apparmor.d/<profile-name>`
   - Otherwise, you can also remove the package: `pacman -R apparmor.d`
   - Alternativelly, you may temporarily disable apparmor as it will allow you to
     boot and studdy the log: `systemctl disable apparmor`
1. Exit, umount, and reboot:
   ```sh
   exit
   umount -R /mnt
   reboot
   ```
1. Create an issue and report the output of `aa-log`


## Tests

A full test suite to ensure compatibility across distributions and softwares is still a work in progress.

Here an overview of the current CI jobs:

**On Gitlab CI**
- Package build for all supported distribution
- Profiles preprocessing verification for all supported distribution
- Go based command linting and unit tests

**On Github Action**
- Integration test on the ubuntu-latest VM: run a simple list of tasks with
  all the rules enabled and ensure no new issue has been raised. Github Action
  is used as it offers a direct access to a VM with AppArmor included.
