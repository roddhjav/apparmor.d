# This profile is designed to be used in a child profile to limit what
# confined application can invoke via xdg-open helper.

# Instead of allowing the run of all software in @{bin}/, the purpose of
# this profile is to list all GUI program that can open resources.

# Ultimatelly, only sandbox manager program like bwrap, snap, flatpak, firejail
# should be present here. Until this day, this profile will be a controlled mess.

# Note: This profile does not specify an attachment path because it is
# intended to be used only via "Px -> child-open" exec transitions
# from other profiles.
