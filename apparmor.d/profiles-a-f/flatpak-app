# Default profile for all flatpak applications. Ideally, this profile should be
# generated by flatpak itself with settings from the flatpak manifest and 
# fully separated from bwrap.

# Note: This profile used to be split in two (flatpak-bwrap & flatpak-app) in order
# to separate bwrap from the sandboxed app itself. It was generating issue with 
# zypak-sandbox, therefore the profiles have been merged. Meanwhile, to install
# some applications, flatpak needs write access to the sandbox content. This is
# done through bwrap and therefore in this profile.
#
# 1. All of this will have to be improved. However, as of today, it is the only way
# to not break some (major) flatpak app.
# 2. It is not a big deal as flatpak is responsible for the sandbox anyway.
