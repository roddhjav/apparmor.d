title: Directives
---

`apparmor.d` supports build directives, they are processed at build time of the project. They are valid AppArmor comments, therefore, `apparmor_parser` can be used on a profile even if the directives have not been processed. They should not end with a comma. Multiline directive is not supported.

The directives follow the format:
```sh
#aa:<name> [options]
```

**`<name>`**

:   The name of the directive to apply


**`[options]`**

:   A (possibly empty) list or map of arguments. Exact format depend on the directive.

## Dbus

See the [dbus page](dbus.md#dbus-directive).

    
## Only, Exclude

The `only` and `exclude` directives can be used to filter individual rule or rule paragraphs depending on the target distribution or distribution family.

**Format**

```sh
#aa:only <filter>
#aa:exclude <filter>
```

**`<filter>`**

:   The filter to apply. Can be:

    - A supported target distribution: `arch`, `debian`, `ubuntu`, `opensuse`, `whonix`.
    - A supported distribution family: `apt`, `pacman`, `zypper`.
    - A supported ABI: `abi3`, `abi4`.

    ``` sh linenums="99"
      #aa:only opensuse
            @{run}/zypp.pid rwk,
      owner @{run}/zypp-rpm.pid rwk,
      owner @{run}/zypp/packages/ r,
    ```

**Generate**

`#aa:only pacman`

:   
    Remove the line/paragraph when the project is not compiled on the Arch Linux family.


## Exec

The `exec` directive is useful to allow executing transitions to a profile without having to manage the possible long list of profile attachments (it varies depending on the distribution). The directive parses and resolves the attachment variable (`@{exec_path}`) of the target profile and includes it in the current profile.

**Format**

```sh
#aa:exec [transition] profiles...
```

**`profiles...`**

:   List of profile **files** that can be executed from the current profile.

**`[transition]`**

:   Optional transition mode (default: `P`). Can be any of: `P`, `U`, `p`, `u`, `PU`, `pu`.

    ``` sh linenums="29"
    #aa:exec kscreenlocker_greet
    ```

**Generate**

`#aa:exec baloo`

:   
    ```sh
    @{bin}/baloo_file Px,
    @{lib}/@{multiarch}/{,libexec/}baloo_file Px,
    @{lib}/{,kf6/}baloo_file Px,
    ```


## Stack

[Stacked](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/AppArmorStacking) profiles can be hard to maintain. The *parent* profile needs to manage its own rules as well as always including access from the *child* profile. In most profile using stacking, the *child* profile is often naturally included in the *parent*. However, sometime the child profile is fully different. This directive automatically include the stacked profile rules into the parent profile.

**Format**

```sh
#aa:stack profiles...
```

**`profiles...`**

:   List a profile **files** to stack at the end of the current profile.

**`[X]`**

:   If `X` is set, the directive will conserve the `x` file rules regardless of the transition. It is not enabled by default as it may conflict with the parent profile. Indeed, automatically adding `Px` and `ix` transition in a profile is a very effective way to have conflict between transitions as you can automatically add rule already present in the profile but with another transition (you would then get the AppArmor error: `profile has merged rule with conflicting x modifiers`).
