Given the **[<span class="pg-red">:material-numeric-1-circle-outline: Ecosystem</span>](ecosystem.md)** context and the **[<span class="pg-green">:material-numeric-2-circle-outline: Threat model</span>](threat.md)** explained in the previous sections, this section presents the security model that should ideally be enforced.

It covers the basic principles, rules and objectives to consider when building a secure system. It may be changed to fit into use case and threat model modification or specific needs.
